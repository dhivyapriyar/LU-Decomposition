# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1.

import numpy as np

from scipy.linalg import lu

A=np.array(eval(input()))

P,L,U=lu(A)

print(L)

print(U)

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
